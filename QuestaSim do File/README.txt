		- 2nd, write (do run.do) in QuestaSim transcript

	2. to run the project with coverage options and save the coverage file then use "run_with_coverage_save.do" file
		- 1st, go to scoreboard file and delete/comment the C++ function call
		- 2nd, write (do run_with_coverage_save.do) in QuestaSim transcript

	3. to run the project with calling the C++ function (DPI) then use "run_dpi.do" file
		- 1st, make sure the function call exists in scoreboard file
